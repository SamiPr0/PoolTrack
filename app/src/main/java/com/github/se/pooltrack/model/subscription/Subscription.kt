/**
 * One subscription PDF the user has added. Several can exist at once (e.g. an expired one kept for
 * reference and the new one replacing it), but only one is ever active at a time.
 *
 * @property id A locally-generated unique identifier.
 * @property uri The content URI of the PDF, as a string.
 * @property displayName A human-readable label, e.g. the file's original name.
 * @property addedAtEpochMilli When this subscription was added, as epoch milliseconds (kept as a
 *   primitive since [kotlinx.serialization] has no built-in support for [Instant]).
 * @property expiresAtEpochMilli When this subscription expires, as epoch milliseconds, or `null` if
 *   it has no date-based expiration. Mutually exclusive with [maxEntries] in the add flow, but
 *   nothing prevents both being set.
 * @property maxEntries The number of entries this subscription is good for, or `null` if it has no
 *   entry-count limit.
 * @property price How much this subscription cost, or `null` if not recorded.
