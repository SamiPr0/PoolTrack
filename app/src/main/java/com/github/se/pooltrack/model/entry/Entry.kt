/**
 * Represents a single confirmed pool entry, i.e. a scan the scanner accepted.
 *
 * @property timestampEpochMilli When the entry was confirmed, as epoch milliseconds (kept as a
 *   primitive since [kotlinx.serialization] has no built-in support for [Instant]).
 * @property subscriptionId The subscription that was active when this entry was confirmed, or
 *   `null` if none was (or for entries recorded before this was tracked). This is what lets an
 *   entry-limited subscription count how many of its entries have actually been used.
 * @property swimDurationMillis How long the swim lasted, in milliseconds, once the user picked
 *   their phone back up and it was reported to them; `null` for entries recorded after swims
 *   stopped being timed (the app asks for a distance instead), and for older ones that never got
 *   it. Kept so old entries still show their duration.
 * @property swimDistanceMeters How far the user swam, in metres, as they logged it; `null` until
 *   they do (or for entries recorded before distances were logged).
 * @property awaitingDistance Whether the user still has to log [swimDistanceMeters]. `true` only
 *   for entries created by confirming a scan, so entries added by hand, imported or recorded before
 *   distances existed are never waiting for one.
