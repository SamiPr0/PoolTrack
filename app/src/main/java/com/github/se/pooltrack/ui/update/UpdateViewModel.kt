 * picked up on the next launch. Any state but [UpdateUiState.None] means the app must not be used

 * downloading and installing instead, and the installer opens by itself as soon as the download is

 * itself is not lost (it is derived from the persisted entry), but its unlock notification only
 * resumes once the user opens the app again.
